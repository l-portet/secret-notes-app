[Live demo](https://vigorous-snyder-ac499a.netlify.app/)

## Structure
The repo's structure is pretty straightforward: The back-end is in `api` folder and the web front-end is in `webapp`.

## Setup
```bash
npm i --prefix api && npm i --prefix webapp 
```

### Environment variables
Don't forget to set the needed env vars (find them in each directory's `.env.sample`).

## Usage
All commands are executed at the root of the project (find their equivalent in each `package.json` if you want an execution in a specific folder).

### Webapp
```bash
npm run webapp:build
```
And serve the `webapp/build` folder.

### API
```bash
npm run api:start
```
