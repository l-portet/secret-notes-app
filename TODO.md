# Todo

## API

- Blacklist on logout
- Use passport (later?)

## Webapp

- Store API token in persistent storage
- Validators on forms
- Use smooth toast notifications
- Alias 'src' in webapp (but it seems to need ejecting)
- Animate button loading
- If more features expected, set a state management logic (redux?)
- Use before route enter function to check if should redirect user based on auth
- Set textarea disabled while fetching data
